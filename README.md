# codeDotOrgModule

This is a simple helper module that I created for my convenience in my AP Computer Science Principles class.

# Description

This module is meant to be used to write code for Code.org in Visual Studio Code, as it offers the same built-in modules as Code.org's code editor offers. This module is not meant to be a substitute to Code.org, as each helper function performs little of anything beyond a print or return statement. The code written in VS Code using this module is meant to be ported into a Code.org project, simply through copy and pasting. The purpose of this module is to allow the programmer to use the preferable user interface of VS Code instead of the Code.org code editor when writing code for a Code.org project.
